        <ul>
            <li>First of all, the Phillippines. Don't go there, it sucks.</li>
            <li>Second of all, San Diego. My ex is there. I miss her. IDK how I feel about the place.</li>
            <li>Seattle. Lived there most of my life - nice enough, but it's changed a lot.</li>
            <li>Anchorage. See: Phillippines. I suppose it's pretty but it feels so... redneck. Backwater. Hopeless.</li>
            <li>I suppose I don't seem to have favorite places anymore, do I?</li>
